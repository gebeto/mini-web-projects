<!DOCTYPE html ><html><body><p>What makes <strong>closures</strong> so great is the fact that they don't need a function definition before we can use them. So, let's get rid of the variable that holds the closure!</p><code><span class="keyword">let</span> myArray = [<span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">2</span>, <span class="number">3</span>]<br /><span class="built_in">print</span>(myArray.<span class="built_in">map</span>(<selection id="selection-1">  <item value="1" correct="true">{ $<span class="number">0</span> * <span class="number">2</span> }</item>  <item value="2" correct="true">{ $<span class="number">0</span> + <span class="number">2</span> }</item></selection>))<output for="selection-1">  <item for="1">[2, 4, 6]</item>  <item for="2">[3, 4, 5]</item></output></code><p visible-if="correct">Sweet! That's a great example of a situation where closures can come in very handy.</p></body></html>
