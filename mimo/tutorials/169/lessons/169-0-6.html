<!DOCTYPE html ><html><body><p>We've seen that variables can point to text, which we call <strong>strings</strong>. As it turns out, though, variables can store so much more. <strong>Numbers</strong>, for example.</p><code>my_string = <span class="string">"8"</span><br />my_number = <selection id="selection-3">  <item value="1" correct="false">    <span class="string">"8"</span>  </item>  <item value="2" correct="true">    <span class="number">8</span>  </item></selection> </code><p visible-if="wrong">Hmm, not quite. That looks a lot like a string! We want to store a <strong>number</strong> in <code>my_number</code>.</p><p visible-if="correct">Excellent work! The main difference is that strings are declared with <strong>quotation marks</strong>, whereas numbers can be written just as they are.</p><p visible-if="correct">Psst: in Ruby, everything is an <strong>object</strong>: <strong>strings</strong>, <strong>numbers</strong>, <strong>variables</strong> ... we'll be learning a few more <strong>objects</strong> as we go!</p></body></html>
