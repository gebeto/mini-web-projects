Since hashes are unordered, we need something else to make their values accessible: <strong>keys</strong>.</p><code>hash = { <span class="string">"name"</span> =&gt; <span class="string">"</span><input id="input-2" /><span class="string">"Â }</span><br />print hash[<span class="string">"name"</span>]<br /><output>  <item>    <print />    <br />  </item></output></code><p visible-if="correct">See that? We've just added a so-called <strong>key-value pair</strong> to <code>hash</code> and asked Ruby to display the value that belongs to its key, <code><span class="string">"name"</span></code>.</p><p visible-if="correct">Psst: while we <em>can</em> use <code>=&gt;</code>, which to assign a value to a key, that's not the only way to get there.</p></body></html>
