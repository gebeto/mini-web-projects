This type of list, however, is a different story.</p><p><strong>Hashes</strong> are <strong>unordered lists</strong> of values, in which each <strong>value</strong> has a <strong>key</strong> that points to it. Again, how might we create such a hash?</p><code>hash = <selection id="selection-1">  <item value="1" correct="true">{}</item>  <item value="2" correct="false">[]</item>  <item value="3" correct="false">()</item></selection> </code><p visible-if="correct">Spot on! <code>{}</code> creates an empty hash.</p><p visible-if="correct">Psst: we've also used <code>{}</code> to declare code blocks but, this time, we're assigning the braces to a <strong>variable</strong> instead of placing them after a method.</p><p visible-if="wrong">Things have changed since we've created an empty array, haven't they?</p></body></html>
