How do you think we should access a particular character in a string?</p><p>Let's find the <strong>third</strong> character of the following <code><span class="built_in">string</span></code>.</p><code><span class="built_in">string</span> str = <span class="string">"Coding is awesome"</span>;<br /><span class="built_in">cout</span> &lt;&lt; str<selection id="selection-1">  <item value="1" correct="false">(<span class="number">2</span>)</item>  <item value="2" correct="false">[<span class="number">3</span>]</item>  <item value="3" correct="true">[<span class="number">2</span>]</item></selection>;<br /><output>  <item for="1"></item>  <item for="2"></item>  <item for="3">d</item></output></code><p visible-if="correct">Sweet. Just like with arrays, we can access a character as if it's an element. Strings are also <strong>zero-indexed</strong>, so we can access the third letter using <code>[<span class="number">2</span>]</code>.</p><p visible-if="wrong">Whoops. Is how we would access the third element in an array?</p></body></html>
