<!DOCTYPE html ><html><body><p>So far, we've created strings by initializing them with a value in quotation marks. There's another way, though, and it uses the <code><span class="keyword">new</span></code> keyword.</p><code>String a = <span class="string">""</span>;<br />String b = <span class="keyword">new</span> String();<br />System.out.print(a.equals(b));<output>  <item>true</item></output></code><p visible-if="correct">See that? <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> both hold an empty string. <code>String()</code> is called a <strong>constructor</strong>, a concept about which we'll talk some more when we dive into <strong>objects</strong>.</p></body></html>
